## Class: `Certificate`

SPKAC is a Certificate Signing Request mechanism originally implemented by
Netscape and was specified formally as part of [HTML5's `keygen` element][].

`<keygen>` is deprecated since [HTML 5.2][] and new projects
should not use this element anymore.

The `node:crypto` module provides the `Certificate` class for working with SPKAC
data. The most common usage is handling output generated by the HTML5
`<keygen>` element. Node.js uses [OpenSSL's SPKAC implementation][] internally.

### exportChallenge {#api/modules/crypto/certificate/methods/exportChallenge}

const spkac = getSpkacSomehow();
const challenge = Certificate.exportChallenge(spkac);
console.log(challenge.toString('utf8'));
// Prints: the challenge as a UTF8 string
```

```cjs
const { Certificate } = require('node:crypto');
const spkac = getSpkacSomehow();
const challenge = Certificate.exportChallenge(spkac);
console.log(challenge.toString('utf8'));
// Prints: the challenge as a UTF8 string
