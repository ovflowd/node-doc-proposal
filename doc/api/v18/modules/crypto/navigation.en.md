- [Module: Crypto](index.md)
  - [Class: Certificate](certificate.md)
  - [Class: Cipher](cipher.md)
  - [Class: Decipher](decipher.md)
  - [`node:crypto` methods and properties](node-crypto.md)

<!-- ** Important Notes **

- As you can see each class has its own file. This trimms down the size of each page and allows easier navigation
- This Navigation is just an example and doesn't represent a realistic scenario, hence it doesn't include everything from this module
- The prefixes such as `Module`, `Class` are generated by the tooling by identifying the type of the Headings

The Navigation files show only the top-level entries of the Navigation, for example, If you open the `Module: Buffers` page
you will have a "ToC - Table of Contents" containing the actual items from that page. Containing entries such as:

- Determining if crypto support is unavailable
- Notes
  - Using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs
  - Legacy streams API (prior to Node.js 0.10)
  - Support for weak or compromised algorithms
  - CCM mode
- Crypto constants
  - OpenSSL options
  - OpenSSL engine constants
  - Other OpenSSL constants
  - Node.js crypto constants

The main `navigation.md` of a module is done to represent the available Classes and main point of interests of a Module (Like a Quick Access).

It is also done like that as classes now are their own files, and independent pages. This is done to reduce the page size, loading time and need to scroll, it also makes classes easier to be indexed.
