- Initially all Navigation entries are generated and follow the specification
- The Navigation Markdown file supports any Markdown syntax and gets converted then to MDX/HTML
- Navigation files can load other Navigation files, the tooling will identify Navigation files by the reserved name `navigation.md`
- Navigation files as any other file here are localised
